ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, 

I am a student with a passion for coding. As a he/him, I have experience with various programming languages such as Java, Python, .Net, C++, and C#. I started with Java from Minecraft modding, and since then, I have explored other languages and gained knowledge and skills.

Currently, I am working on several projects, including Sketchbook, a project in active development, Order of the Titans, a project not in active development, and FoodNStuff, a project with paused development. I am also working on uwbt (U won't beat that), but unfortunately, I am still looking for my backup. Additionally, I have created a German HTML+CSS CheatSheet for webpages and will continue to update it when I can.

I am always excited to learn more and improve my skills, so feel free to connect with me and collaborate on projects together.
