# schnow265 💻

## 👋 Hi there

I am an Austrian student with a passion for coding and a proud owner of an [ECDL Certificate](https://icdl.org/). I have experience with various programming languages such as:

* Java,
* Python,
* .Net,
* C++,
* and C#.

I started with __Java__ from Minecraft modding (mainly FabricMC), and since then, I have explored other languages and gained knowledge and skills. Some of my Skills are the knowledge __bash__, __sh__ and __pwsh__. I gained these because I am using currently _GNU/Linux_.
