## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I am an Austrian student with a passion for coding and a proud owner of an [ECDL Certificate](https://icdl.org/). I have experience with various programming languages such as:

* Java,
* Python,
* .Net,
* C++,
* and C#.

I started with __Java__ from Minecraft modding (mainly FabricMC), and since then, I have explored other languages and gained knowledge and skills. Some of my Skills are the knowledge __bash__, __sh__ and __pwsh__. I gained these because I am using currently _GNU/Linux_. 

What Distro am I currently using?

| Distro  | Timeframe               | Device    |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| POP-os  | 03.09.2023 - 03.04.2023 | Laptop    |
| Fedora  | 03.04.2023 - _now_     | Laptop    |
| SteamOS | since I got the Device  | SteamDeck |

Currently, I am working on several projects, including [Sketchbook](https://github.com/schnow265/Sketchbook/), a project in active development, [Order of the Titans](https://github.com/schnow265/Order-of-the-Titans), a project not in active development, and [FoodNStuff](https://github.com/schnow265/foodnstuff), a project with paused development. I am also working on [uwbt (U won&#39;t beat that)](https://github.com/schnow265/uwbt), but unfortunately, I am still looking for my backup. Additionally, I have created a __German__ [HTML + CSS CheatSheet for webpages](https://github.com/schnow265/Cheat-sheet-of-Webpages) and will continue to update it when I can. My recent Addition to my Profile are [The MD Files](https://github.com/schnow265/the_md_files), where I write my opinions on Video Games, Books and Music. Need some random Python Scripts? Look no further than [random-stuff](https://github.com/schnow265/random-stuff).
