## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I am an Austrian developer with a passion for coding and a proud owner of an [ECDL Certificate](https://icdl.org/). I have experience with various programming languages such as:

* Python,
* Java,
* TypeScript (Angular),
* PowerShell (Yes, it's a language - surprise, surprise),
* bash,
* .Net,
* C++,
* C#

I started with __Java__ from Minecraft modding (*mainly FabricMC*), and since then, I have explored other languages and gained knowledge and skills. Some of my Skills are knowledge in the Console Scripts __sh__ and __pwsh__. I gained these because I am using currently _GNU/Linux_.
