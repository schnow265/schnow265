## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I am an Austrian developer with a passion for coding and a proud owner of an [ECDL Certificate](https://icdl.org/). I have experience with various programming languages such as:

* Java,
* Python,
* .Net,
* C++,
* and C#.

I started with __Java__ from Minecraft modding (mainly FabricMC), and since then, I have explored other languages and gained knowledge and skills. Some of my Skills are the knowledge __bash__, __sh__ and __pwsh__. I gained these because I am using currently _GNU/Linux_.

What Distro am I currently using?

| Distro  | Timeframe               | Device    |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| POP!_OS  | 03.09.2023 - 03.04.2023 | Laptop    |
| Fedora  | 03.04.2023 - _now_     | Laptop    |
| SteamOS | since I got the Device  | SteamDeck |

Buuuut there is a problem with my Fedora Usage: I liked to break it. Once I removed the *entirety* of the pip-Folder to free up space. As a note, __dnf__, the package Manager of Fedora, is made in Python. And I couldn't just type *pip install dnf*, because it said that I need to install the package **python3-dnf** via the systems package manager. So, how often did I reinstall it?

**The Fedora Re-install Counter**
| Number | Spin | Time | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Workstation | 03.04.2023 | - |
| 1 | KDE Spin | - | I hate GNOME |
| 2 | Kionite | - | pip - Folder |
| 3 | KDE Spin | 15.07.2023 | I can't use rpm-ostree anymore! No tools are working! I can't even install **pip**! |


> Why do I switch so much? The answer is **YES**

Currently, I am working on several projects, including [Sketchbook](https://github.com/schnow265/Sketchbook/), a project in active development, [Order of the Titans](https://github.com/schnow265/Order-of-the-Titans), an archived attempt to make a mod. May get a rebuild. Additionally, I have created a __German__ [HTML + CSS CheatSheet for webpages](https://github.com/schnow265/Cheat-sheet-of-Webpages) and will continue to update it when I can. My recent Addition to my Profile are [The MD Files](https://github.com/schnow265/the_md_files), where I write my opinions on Video Games, Books and Music. Need some random Python Scripts? Look no further than [random-stuff](https://github.com/schnow265/random-stuff).
