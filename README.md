# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I am a student with a passion for coding. I have experience with various programming languages such as Java, Python, .Net, C++, and C#. I started with Java from Minecraft modding, and since then, I have explored other languages and gained knowledge and skills.

Currently, I am working on several projects, including [Sketchbook](https://github.com/schnow265/Sketchbook/), a project in active development, [Order of the Titans](https://github.com/schnow265/Order-of-the-Titans), a project not in active development, and [FoodNStuff](https://github.com/schnow265/foodnstuff), a project with paused development. I am also working on [uwbt (U won't beat that)](https://github.com/schnow265/uwbt), but unfortunately, I am still looking for my backup. Additionally, I have created a __German__ [HTML+CSS CheatSheet for webpages](https://github.com/schnow265/Cheat-sheet-of-Webpages) and will continue to update it when I can.
