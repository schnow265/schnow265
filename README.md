## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I am an Austrian developer with a passion for coding and a proud owner of an [ECDL Certificate](https://icdl.org/). I have experience with various programming languages such as:

* Python,
* Java,
* PowerShell (Yes, it's a language - surprise, surprise),
* bash,
* .Net,
* C++,
* C#

I started with __Java__ from Minecraft modding (*mainly FabricMC*), and since then, I have explored other languages and gained knowledge and skills. Some of my Skills are knowledge in the Console Scripts __sh__ and __pwsh__. I gained these because I am using currently _GNU/Linux_.

## Linux Knowledge

| Distro | Use case | Familiarity | Install type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parrot OS | A little bit of HackTheBox-ing | Yeah, it's Debian. | VM |
| wsl (Yes, I count that) | Building binaries with better tools than on Windows | It's bash. | SubSystem |
| Fedora / RHEL-based System | Daily Live System | Daily-Driver | Bare Metal |
| Kali Linux | Advanced HTB-ing | same as ParrotOS | VM |
| Arch Linux | Haha, Funny Number goes up | archinstall | VM |
| Ubuntu | Let's try it | Me: "I now know Linux, but this is trash"  | VM |
| ZorinOS | [funny Minecraft Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vm-computers) | Good performance, but still: | VM |

### What Distro am I currently using?

|Distro |Timeframe              |Device   |
|-------|-----------------------|---------|
|POP!_OS|03.09.2023 - 03.04.2023|Laptop   |
|Fedora |03.04.2023 - _now_     |Laptop   |
|SteamOS|since I got the Device |SteamDeck|

But there is a problem with my Fedora Usage: I liked to break it. Once I removed the *entirety* of the pip-Folder to free up space. As a note, __dnf__, the package Manager of Fedora, is made in Python. And I couldn't just type *pip install dnf*, because it said that I need to install the package **python3-dnf** via the systems package manager. So, how often did I reinstall it?

Currently, I am working on several projects, including [Sketchbook](https://github.com/schnow265/Sketchbook/), a project in active development, [Order of the Titans](https://github.com/schnow265/Order-of-the-Titans), an archived attempt to make a mod. May get a rebuild. Additionally, I have created a __German__ [HTML + CSS CheatSheet for webpages](https://github.com/schnow265/Cheat-sheet-of-Webpages) and will continue to update it when I can. Need some random Python Scripts? Look no further than [random-stuff](https://github.com/schnow265/random-stuff).
